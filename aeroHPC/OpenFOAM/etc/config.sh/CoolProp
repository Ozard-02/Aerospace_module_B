# Description
#     Configuration file for CoolProp include/libraries.
#     Sourced from OpenFOAM-<VERSION>/etc/bashrc
#

#     To couple CoolProp (http://www.coolprop.org) to OpenFOAM, please:
#
#     1) install CoolProp according to the following steps:
#
#         # Go to foam3rdParty dir:
#         cd $FOAM_THIRD_PARTY
#
#         # Check out the sources from CoolProp
#         git clone https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp --recursive
#
#         # Move into the folder you just created
#         cd CoolProp
#
#         # Make a build folder
#         mkdir build && cd build
#
#         # check cmake compilers are consistent with the OF installation
#         export CC="$WM_CC"
#         export CXX="$WM_CXX"
#
#         # Generate builder (defaults to 64-bit on 64-bit machine)
#         cmake .. -DCOOLPROP_SHARED_LIBRARY=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
#
#         # Build
#         cmake --build .
#
#     2) You need to add CoolProp/build folder to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
#
#     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$WM_THIRD_PARTY_DIR/CoolProp/build:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
#
#     3) In the source code, please remember to insert in the header files:
#
#         #define COOLPROP_LIB
#         #include "CoolPropLib.h"

# installation type (local/network/thesis)
export COOLPROP_ARCH_PATH=$WM_THIRD_PARTY_DIR/CoolProp

# include (header) files
export COOLPROP_INCLUDE_DIR=$COOLPROP_ARCH_PATH/include

# dynamic libraries
export COOLPROP_LIB_DIR=$COOLPROP_ARCH_PATH/build


if [ -d "$COOLPROP_ARCH_PATH" ]
then
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$COOLPROP_LIB_DIR:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    if [ "$FOAM_VERBOSE" -a "$PS1" ]
    then
        echo "Using COOLPROP" 1>&2
        echo "    at $COOLPROP_ARCH_PATH" 1>&2
    fi
else
    unset COOLPROP_ARCH_PATH COOLPROP_LIB_DIR COOLPROP_INCLUDE_DIR
fi
